## TODO:

Script/Program as frame which encompasses the whole operation (see approach-diagram) (owner: ?)

Run-Script (read/reorg input for further use (MOHEFT), run MOHEFT + calc hypervolume) (owner: ?)

MOHEFT impl. (owners: ?)

Hypervolume calculation (owner: ?)

Optimum calculation (owner: ?)

Evaluation (comparison of Hypervolumes with optimum) (owner: ?)



ETC:
one Hypervolume per run (result)
because of GA -> use multiple runs as a run may yield different results (from others)
use hypervolume to make results comparable  -> select best one to be compared to optimum
